## What's Inside the Dashboard:
i) KPIs
ii) Visuals:
  - Bar charts for sales by category and top 10 products
  - Line graph
  - Pie chart: category-wise sales
  - Tables showing detailed records
iii)Filters/Slicers:
  - Filter by region
  - Filter by category
  - Monthly/year selection to drill into time-based data
iv)Decomposition tree explaining total sales 

## Purpose of the Dashboard:
		The goal is to help users see where sales are coming from, from which segment the most profit is gained.It might be useful for decision-making in 
business and marketing.
